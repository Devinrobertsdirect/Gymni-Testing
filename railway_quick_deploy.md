# Quick Railway Deployment (5 minutes)

## Since Replit isn't working yet, let's use Railway instead!

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repo: `Devinrobertsdirect/Gymni-Testing`
5. Railway will automatically detect it's Laravel and deploy it

### Step 2: Get Your Railway URL
- Railway will give you a URL like: `https://gymni-testing-production.up.railway.app`
- Copy this URL

### Step 3: Update Frontend
Update `a0-project (2)/a0-project/config/api.ts`:
```typescript
export const BASE_API_URL = 'https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api';
```

### Step 4: Test API
Test: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/login`

### Step 5: Build for TestFlight
```bash
cd "a0-project (2)/a0-project"
npx eas build --platform ios
```

## Why Railway is Better for This:
- ✅ Automatically detects Laravel
- ✅ Handles environment setup
- ✅ Provides database automatically
- ✅ Very reliable
- ✅ Free tier available

## Alternative: Fix Replit
If you want to stick with Replit:
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Make sure it's running (click "Run")
3. Check the webview tab for the correct URL
4. Look for any error messages

## Total Time: 5 minutes with Railway
Railway will have your API running in about 5 minutes!
