# Fix Stripe Autoloading Warnings

## The Issue
Your Laravel backend has Stripe library files that don't follow PSR-4 autoloading standards. This causes warnings but doesn't break functionality.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Exclude Stripe from PSR-4 (Recommended)
Add this to your `composer.json` in the backend:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\": "app/"
    },
    "exclude-from-classmap": [
      "app/Stripe/"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Move Stripe to vendor directory
Move the Stripe folder from `app/Stripe/` to `vendor/stripe/`

### Option 3: Use Composer's Stripe package
Replace the manual Stripe files with:
```bash
composer require stripe/stripe-php
```

## For Now - Continue with TestFlight
These warnings won't prevent your app from working. Your API is still functional at:

## Next Steps:
1. Your backend is working fine despite the warnings
2. Continue with the iOS build for TestFlight
3. Fix the autoloading later if needed

The warnings are cosmetic and don't affect your app's functionality!
