# Fix Your Replit Deployment

## Let's get your Replit API working!

### Step 1: Check Your Replit Project
1. Go to https://replit.com/@devinrobertsdir/Gymni-Testing
2. Look at the console/terminal area
3. Check if there are any error messages

### Step 2: Make Sure It's Running
1. Click the "Run" button if it's not already running
2. Wait for it to start up completely
3. Look for a message saying "Your app is live at..."

### Step 3: Find the Correct URL
1. Look in the "Webview" tab
2. The URL might be different than expected
3. Common formats:
   - `https://your-project-name.your-username.repl.co`
   - `https://your-project-name.repl.co`
   - `https://replit.com/@devinrobertsdir/Gymni-Testing`

### Step 4: Check Laravel Configuration
Make sure your Replit project has:
1. **Proper .replit file** for Laravel
2. **Environment variables** set in Secrets
3. **Database configuration** (SQLite or MySQL)

### Step 5: Common Replit Issues
- **Project not running**: Click "Run" button
- **Wrong URL**: Check webview tab for correct URL
- **Laravel not configured**: Need proper .replit file
- **Database issues**: Set up SQLite or external MySQL

### Step 6: Test Your API
Once you find the correct URL, test:
- `https://your-correct-url.repl.co/api/login`
- Should return JSON (even if it's an error message)

## What to Look For:
1. **Is the project running?** (green "Run" button)
2. **What's the correct URL?** (in webview tab)
3. **Any error messages?** (in console)
4. **Is Laravel properly configured?** (check .replit file)

## Quick Fixes:
- **If not running**: Click "Run"
- **If wrong URL**: Use the URL from webview
- **If Laravel issues**: Add proper .replit configuration
- **If database issues**: Use SQLite or set up MySQL
